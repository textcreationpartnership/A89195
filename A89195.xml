         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Oh this world is a mighty hinderance to ſuffering! When God cals into the Mount, theſe earthly comforts and contentments are like a great clog on our hearts, and hinder us much.

               <p n="3">3. Conſider the neceſſity of ſuffering and tryals, it cannot well be otherwiſe in reſpect of our condition, in reſpect of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and the place where we live.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in reſpect of our condition, both preſent and future in Heaven,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of our preſent condition. The faithfull, the godly are Souldiers, Labourers, Sowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now conſider all theſe, and ſee if there be not a kind of neceſſity, in reſpect of their condition of meeting with troubles.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The true Chriſtian is a <hi>Souldier,</hi> and a Souldier muſt meet with ſtraits, hard ſervices ſometimes, fight hard before he gets the victory, endure blowes and dangerous wounds ſometimes,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:112829:22"/>runne through the pikes (as we ſay) before he gets the victory, ſo muſt a Chriſtian. A Chriſtians life is a warfare, and you know, it is no new thing for Souldiers, to heare the Drum beat, Trumpets ſound, the Cannons roare and Bullets fly about their Ears and Heads, and ſomtimes dangerouſly pierce their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; ſo it is not to be wondred at, much leſſe murmur'd at: If Satan and evill men let fly at us; if afflictions and troubles come: Therefore if we be Chriſts Souldiers, let us looke for ſuch things, make a ſure account of them, yea, and ſometimes to have them thick and three-fold like <hi>Jobs</hi> Meſſengers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A true Chriſtian is a <hi>Labourer.</hi> A Labourer muſt work early and late, labour hard, undergoe much paine and travell: So the husband-man muſt not onely worke hard, but endure many a cold blaſt, many a ſtorme before he gets the crop in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Barne; ſo the godly muſt looke to undergoe many a hard ſervice, indure many a ſtorme of affliction, before he comes to the harveſt, to triumph in Heaven. This in reſpect of our preſent condition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of our future condition. Heaven is a time of reſt, of triumph, and reaping a harveſt: Now reſt is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter motion, and there can be no triumph before victory, and no victory with ſitting ſtill,<note place="margin">Quies eſt finis motus.</note> without blowes, Before a man can reape he muſt endure a great deale of labour, wet and dry, heat and cold, hunger and thirſt: a husbandmans life is a laborious and painfull life; and ſo it muſt be with the true Chriſtian before he comes to tryumph and reape the fruits of a ſound profeſſion, and a wel-led life in Heaven. Thus in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our condition both preſent and future.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in reſpect of our enemies, it cannot bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Divell</hi> a moſt implacable enemy, <hi>who continually goeth about like a roaring Lyon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.8.</note> 
                  <hi>ſeeking whom he may devoure,</hi> by all wayes and meanes, and at all times, ſeeking to marre our peace, imbitter our lives, yea, to deſtroy our ſoules.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wicked men have a moſt invenomed nature (all of them) againſt godlineſſe and an inveterate enmity againſt the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:112829:22"/>righteous, though they doe not alwayes equally ſhew it; God reſtraines them all more or leſſe, for the good of his people, there ſhould otherwiſe be no living for the righteous upon the earth among evill men: and of all Sects and Religions, none are more cruell and blood-thirſty then the Papiſts are, eſpecially the Prieſts and Jeſuites, and therefore it cannot be expected, but that the godly ſhould meet with troubles in this world, in reſpect of our malignant enemies, even all the troubles they can procure.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In reſpect of the place where wee live, likened to a Wilderneſſe, to a Sea. As it was with <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they went out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> they went through the Wilderneſſe: So muſt the faithfull <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God doe now, to goe to Heaven, paſſe through the Wilderneſſe of this world. Now in a Wilderneſſe there are Bryars and Thornes, Wolves, Beares, Lyons, Serpents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it is not ſtrange for the honeſt Traveller to meet with ſuch creatures there; even ſo the godly meet with ſuch kind of men in this world, who are ever and anon ready to vex, trouble and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure them. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>My ſoule dwelleth among Lyons.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 57.4. &amp; 22.21.</note> Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men are in the ſacred Scriptures, likened to, and called Lyons, Doggs, Wolves, Vipers, Serpents and almoſt all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſavage beaſts, becauſe they have the like evill diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and doe like actions, and the godly are compared to Lambes, Doves, Sheepe, and other ſuch like harmleſſe, profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table creatures, no marvell then, if the godly be aſſaulted and put hard to it many times by evill men.</p>
               <p>The world is alſo likened to a Sea, and we ſayle (as it were) in the barke of our fraile bodies, now what is more uſuall then to have windes and ſtormes at Sea? to be toſſed to and fro, to meet with foule weather? to heare the waves roare and rage and daſh into the ſhip, alſo ſometimes to light on the rocks, yea, to ſuffer ſhipwrack on the rocks and dangerous ſands? So if (as we ſayle in the barke of our fraile bodie towards Heaven) the windes blow, and ſtormes ariſe, ready to ſinke our ſhip or ſplit her on the rockes, is it any new or ſtrange thing that wee ſhould be much moved at it? It is therefore a point of wiſedome to prepare for, and patiently undergoe what
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:112829:23"/>cannot be avoided; many Heathens have on this conſideration undergone much, and why ſhould not Chriſtians much more make a vertue of neceſſity?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider the nature of theſe troubles, they are light and ſhort.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Light,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4 17</note> Take them at the worſt they are but light afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>n, and wound that at moſt and worſt they can doe, they may annoy, yet they doe not deſtroy the ſoule, prejudice it's eternall wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; but wicked mens troubles many times wound the ſoule, pierce into the very ſoule, and deſtroy that, and though they be free from bodily troubles, yet they have crazy conſciences which ſometimes wound them ſore, and <hi>a wounded spirit who can beare?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.28. Pro. 18.14.</note> or <hi>what can it beare,</hi> as the Originall hath it. So long as the ſpirit is ſound, conſcience cleare and good, it will ſuſtaine it's infirmity, <hi>i e.</hi> whatſoever outward trouble may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall; as a ſound ſhoulder will beare a great weight with elſe and pleaſure, whereas a broken, bruiſed or diſ-joynted ſhoulder, will cry out and ſhrinke under every little thing. <hi>All the daies of the afflicted are evill, but he that is of a merry heart, hath a continuall Feaſt.</hi> A cleare and ſound conſcience is as a Feaſt in the middeſt of all outward troubles, yea, and better then a Feaſt for it is continuall.</p>
               <p>The truth is, it is guiltineſſe of conſcience that makes afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons heavy; to a ſound and good conſcience great afflictions and tryals many times ſeeme as nothing, and are undergone with a great deale of cheerfulneſſe and courage, but when God plagues a wicked man, if conſcience be not ſeared or a ſleep, or benummed he hath a double burden to beare, the weight of affliction and a guilty conſcience, which is moſt grievous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As they are <hi>Light,</hi> ſo alſo <hi>ſhort</hi> and <hi>momentary. The rod of the wicked ſhall not reſt on the lot of the righteous.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, God ſometimes weakens the Adverſaries power, and delivers his people,<note place="margin">Exod. 14.25.</note> by ſpoyling them of their inſtruments, which are very helpefull to them: So God tooke off the wheeles of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Chariots, and made them drive hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily, ſo that they could not follow after <hi>Iſrael</hi> to hurt them.</p>

                  <note place="margin">2 Sam 17 7, 14</note> So God turned <hi>Ahito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phels</hi> politick counſell (that would have been very prejudiciall to <hi>David</hi> and his men) into fooliſhneſſe,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 10.</note> and <hi>Abſalom</hi> to reject it, and follow the counſell of <hi>Huſhai</hi> to his owne deſtruction. And <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to follow the adviſe of the young men, that were brought up with him, and to reject the counſell of the grave men, to his owne great dammage and diſhonour. Thus God ſometimes by infatuating the counſels of the Adverſaries of his people, and ſmiting them in their wits, doth diſable them to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their deſignes againſt his people, and ſo delivers them as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> from <hi>Abſolom,</hi> and petitioning <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Rehoboams</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded cruelty, and ſo make their owne counſels and deſignes their own over-throw and fall, and the riſe of his people.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſometimes by taking away from the enemies of the Church, part of their ſtrength in which they truſt, as he did from <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> by rending ten Tribes, the farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of his Dominion from him,<note place="margin">2 Chr. 10.13.</note> when he would not be diſſwaded from going on to oppreſſe his petitioning Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, ſometimes by reſtraining their malice, when it comes to the upſhot, and turning their hearts towards his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and enclining them to peace;<note place="margin">Gen. 32.6. with 33.4, 10.</note> as when <hi>Eſau</hi> came againſt <hi>Iacob</hi> with 400. men, God over-power'd his ſpirit, and turned his heart to his brother <hi>Iacob, That</hi> Jacob <hi>ſaw his face, as the face of an Angell of God.</hi>

So he hath put exceeding much courage and valour into the ſouldiers in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to doe very great things againſt the Rebels there, and obtaine wonderfull victories almoſt incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Sometimes the Lord ſends his people, wholly by unexpected wayes, which they thought not of, whereby they become victorious over their enemies, and free themſelves from them. So God raiſed up deliverance to his people in <hi>Zachary,</hi> when there were 4. <hi>hornes,</hi> that is, enemies of the Church on all ſides, that ſtood up to ſcatter his people <hi>Iſrael, Judah,</hi> and <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem:</hi> The Lord ſhewed the Prophet 4 <hi>Carpenters, i. e.</hi> the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians and Grecians, whom God had raiſed up, as his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to help his people, and breake the hornes of the enemies
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:112829:28"/>againſt them. Here comes help by a way altogether unexpected, which his people never ſo much as thought of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord ſomtimes delivers his people by diſcovering the enemies plots and deſignes againſt them, before they take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, though never ſo cloſely contrived, and ſecretly carried, and a plot timely diſcovered is prevented, and fals to nothing, but to the hurt of the plotters. <hi>Thus God ſaved Iſrael, not once or twice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Kin. 6.8. &amp;c.</note> by diſcovering the counſels and deſignes of the King of <hi>Syria</hi> againſt them: The Jewes, by diſcovering the bloudy plot of <hi>Haman</hi> againſt them: The Jewes plot againſt <hi>Saul,</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Sometimes God delivers his people by diverting the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies power another way. So when <hi>Saul</hi> came againſt <hi>David,</hi> and had almoſt compaſſed him about, and taken him and his men in the wilderneſſe of <hi>Maon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 23.26, 27</note> a ſudden unexpected invaſion of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> inforced <hi>Saul</hi> to retire, and turne his forces againſt the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi>

               <p>Now thirdly, the reaſons why the Lord will doe ſo, and they are theſe:</p>

So God dealt with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he did not deſtroy him at the firſt, when he ſlew and drowned the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> children, nor at his firſt refuſall to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> goe, as he might juſtly have done; but lets him goe on ſo long, that his obſtinacy &amp; rebellion againſt him, was ſo manifeſt, that all the world could not but ſay, yea, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelfe confeſſe,<note place="margin">Exod 9.27.</note>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>God will be ſeen in the Mount,</hi> and deliver his people in their extremities, to manifeſt his glorious Attributes of knowledge, power, truth, faithfulneſſe and goodneſſe.</p>

               <p>Laſtly (by way of motive, and which is ſpecially applicable to publike mercies) <hi>Remember that publicke mercies are every mans private mercies,</hi> every ones private good is wrapt up in the publik: If it goe well with the publicke, all fare the better for it, if evill, all ſhare in it; as in the body naturall, if the whole body be out of order, all the members ſuffer with it, if ſound and well, all the members ſimpathize with it; and ſo it is in the body myſticall and politick, the Church &amp; Common-wealth; therfore be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ull for publicke mercies, as well, yea rather, and more then for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; becauſe they doe concerne both our owne particular, and others good, whoſe welfare we ought heartily to deſire, pray for and rejoyce in, as fellow members of the body politicke and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But ſome ſay, What muſt I doe that I may be kindly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with mercies and deliverances, and how may I continue the remembrance of them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To the firſt, <hi>to be kindly affected with mercies and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> doe 4. things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Take notice of all,</hi> more eſpecially of more remarkeable,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:112829:46"/>ſpeciall and extraordinary mercies, ſupportment in, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of troubles; for mercies that paſſe unobſerved can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thankfully acknowledged, much leſſe the remembrance of them perpetuated. And doe not onely obſerve them, but take a full view of them, how great, free, undeſerved and ſutable they are to our condition: for theſe conſiderations help much to affect the heart with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Often meditate on them,</hi> well weigh and ponder them, as the faithfull did, <hi>Pſal</hi> 48. <hi>We have thought on thy loving kindneſſe, O God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 48.9.</note> The word ſignifieth (as ſome have obſerved) as much as <hi>aſſimulavimus, we have made an Image of it in our minds,</hi> by ſerious pondering it hath made a deep impreſſion in our minds. The more a man doth meditate and roule any thing in his mind, the deeper impreſſion it makes, and the longer it continues; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labour to worke and imprint it on the heart by meditation.</p>
               <p>But looke not too much on thy afflictions and wants, or what others have which thou haſt not, but on Gods benefits and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies received and promiſed, and on what thou haſt more then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others: For if a man be much poring on his wants and others fulneſſe, or the greater mercies that ſome others have, this will indiſpoſe a man to duty, dead the heart, beget diſcontent, and imbitter the ſoule; but the often remembrance of mercies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and promiſed, and ſpecially of what himſelfe hath, which ſuch and ſuch a man, and many others (far better) have not, will ſweeten the ſpirit, rejoyce the heart, quicken a man and put life into him, make him more apt and active feelingly to praiſe God for them, and performe any good duty; it is as <hi>oyle</hi> to all holy actions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Labour the heart to have a ſenſe and feeling of the worth of them</hi> and to have an high eſteem and holy admiration of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.7.</note> as <hi>David</hi> had, <hi>How great is thy goodneſſe?</hi> by conſidering the greatneſſe, number, variety, the freeneſſe of his mercies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of them, alſo how happy we are with them, and how miſerable without them; for it is not the having, but the prizing and high eſteeming of a benefit that affects the heart and moves the will to thankfulneſſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Labour to be ſtill poore in spirit,</hi> and to be alwayes conſcious of thine owne unworthineſſe, that thou mayeſt know thy ſelfe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:112829:46"/>to be leſſe then the leaſt of all his mercies, as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid;<note place="margin">Gen. 32.10.</note> for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is the beſt ſawce, it makes every thing reliſh well; every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell ſeemes ſweet to the hungry ſoule: ſo poverty of ſpirit makes the leaſt mercy ſeem great; The poore hungry beggar takes the leaſt and worſt ſcraps thankfully, which a full ſoule rejecteth and ſcorneth: ſo a man that is poore in ſpirit hath a ſenſe of his owne unworthineſſe, meane conceits of himſelfe, is thankfull for every mercy, thinks every thing more then he deſerves, and all thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe too little for what he hath already, and therefore ſtands admiring at great and extraordinary mercies.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond I anſwer, That to continue the remembrance of ſpeciall mercies and deliverances, it will help much, and the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have uſed,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To write them down and ſet them upon record,</hi> that they which lived after them might reade them, and be affected with them, and thankfull for them. To this purpoſe were the <hi>Chronicles</hi> of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> of old, and of the Chriſtians under the New Teſtament; even Heathens have ever uſed to doe thus, record ſpeciall mercies and deliverances,<note place="margin">Heſt. 6.1. Erza 4.15.</note> as we reade of <hi>Ahaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erus</hi> his times in <hi>Heſter,</hi> of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Tell them to your children, and charge them to tell them to their children. So we are commanded,<note place="margin">Deut. 4, 9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Only take heed to thy ſelfe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Iſrael</hi>) <hi>that thou forget not the things which thine eyes have ſeen, but teach them thy children, ſpecially the day that thou ſtoodeſt before the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>They may be continued,</hi> and ſo the Saints have uſed to continue the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of ſpecial mercies. 1. <hi>In the names of their children.</hi> So was <hi>Enoch, Moſes, Samuel</hi> and many others named, and it was very uſuall to record ſpeciall paſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
